# City Recommendation System
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrewobi/City-Recommendation-System/master)
This project was created for the WGU Capstone, this was my final project before finishing up my degree in Computer Science. It's a recommendation system that uses a cleaned up dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ramjasmaurya/best-cities-and-countries-for-startups-in-2021). The system is based on the k nearest neighbor algorithm. The code is run using a Jyupter Notebook. 

The code can be run on my binder and a button that links you to it can be seen above.
